 
To maximize performance for ext4 file system, you can consider the following options:

    Mount options:
        noatime:        Disable updating the access timestamps on files, reducing disk I/O.
        nodiratime:     Disable updating directory access timestamps, providing further I/O reduction.
        data=writeback  Use writeback mode for data journaling, which improves performance at the cost of potential data loss in case of power failure or system crash.
        barrier=0:      Disable barriers, which can improve performance in some cases but may increase the risk of data corruption in case of power failure or system crash.
        Example of mounting with these options: mount -o noatime,nodiratime,data=writeback,barrier=0 /dev/sdx /mnt

    Allocation policies:
        extent-based allocation (default): It allocates large contiguous blocks for files, reducing fragmentation and improving read/write performance.
        delayed allocation:                It delays the actual allocation of disk blocks until necessary, reducing disk I/O and improving performance.
        journaling mode:                   You can choose between data=ordered (default), data=writeback, or data=journal for different tradeoffs between performance and data integrity.

    File system tuning:
        Increase the filesystem read-ahead value (/sys/block/<device>/queue/read_ahead_kb) to a larger size to optimize disk access patterns for files and directories.
        Disable or minimize the disk write-caching (if it is enabled) to ensure data consistency but at the expense of performance.

It is essential to note that while these options can improve performance, they may also increase the risk of data loss or corruption.
It is recommended to carefully evaluate the trade-offs and backup important data regularly.
