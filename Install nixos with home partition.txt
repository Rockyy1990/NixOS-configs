 
To install NixOS with a separate home partition, follow the steps below:

    Boot into the NixOS installation media.
    Once booted, open a shell by pressing Ctrl + Alt + F2.
    Partition your disk using a tool like parted or gdisk. Ensure you have a separate partition for the home directory.
        For example, if your disk is /dev/sda, you can create a partition for the home directory as /dev/sda3.
    Format the partitions using the appropriate filesystem. For the home partition, you can use a filesystem like ext4 or btrfs if preferred.
        For example, if the home partition is /dev/sda3, you can format it with mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3.
    Mount the root partition (usually /dev/sda1) to /mnt:


    mount /dev/sda1 /mnt

    Create a directory for the home partition in /mnt:


    mkdir /mnt/home

    Mount the home partition to /mnt/home:


    mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/home

    Generate a NixOS configuration using nixos-generate-config:


    nixos-generate-config --root /mnt

    Open the generated configuration file in a text editor:


    nano /mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix

    Modify the configuration.nix file to include the home option. Below is an example configuration:


{ config, pkgs, ... }:

{
  # ...

  # Set the mount point for the home partition
  fileSystems."/home" = {
    device = "/dev/sda3";
    fsType = "ext4"; # or the filesystem format you used
  };

  # ...
}

    Save and exit the text editor.
    Install NixOS to the mounted partitions by running:


    nixos-install

    This will copy the necessary files to the installed system.
    Once the installation process completes, restart your computer:


    reboot

    Remove the installation media to boot into the newly installed NixOS.

After rebooting, you should have NixOS installed with a separate home partition.
